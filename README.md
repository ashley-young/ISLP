Introduction to Statistical Learning with _Python_ :)

Python version of the labs of the classical book _An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R_ by
Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani, published by Springer.

Originally those labs are presented in R code. I think it would be great to rewrite each lab in Python using Jupyter notebooks
and share with everybody.

The code will make use of the standard stack for data science in Python: numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib and of course
scikit-learn.

The book is available for free on ![the book's page](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/index.html).

## Labs

The labs are as follows:

* 2 - Introduction to R
* 3 - Linear Regression

* 6.2 - Ridge Regression and the Lasso
* 6.3 - PCR and PLS Regression
* 7 - Non-linear Modeling
* 8 - Decision Trees
* 9 - Support Vector Machines
* 10.1 - Principal Component Analysis

are just coding exercises that can be useful or at least interesting to some readers.
